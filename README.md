  bun install

## Configuring the backend

Although the template can be configured with any backend service by only changing a few lines of code, this template uses appwrite for collecting emails.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. You will need the project ID, project name, and endpoint from your [appwrite dashboard](https://cloud.appwrite.io/console).

If you are new to appwrite, you can read the [quick start documentation with react](https://appwrite.io/docs/quick-starts/react).
